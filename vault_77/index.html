        <h2>Story        </h2>
        <p>In the wasteland, a tattered map surfaces, promising salvation: Vault 77, a pre-Collapse haven rumored to hold advanced technology and resources. Driven by dwindling supplies and the ever-present threat of raiders and starvation, a band of survivors embarks on a perilous journey to find it. Their path is fraught with danger: treacherous terrain, mutated creatures, and desperate factions vying for control of the wasteland. As they approach the vault, they discover that it is not abandoned. A faction of technologically advanced survivors has claimed it, and they are unwilling to share. The players must choose: negotiate, fight, or find a way to infiltrate the vault. Their choices will determine not only their own survival but also the fate of those they encounter in the wasteland.        </p>

      <h2>World      </h2>
      <div class="intro">
        <div class="world-description">
          <h3>Geography          </h3>
          <p>The wasteland is a harsh and unforgiving landscape. Once-fertile lands are now barren, scarred by the cataclysm. Dust storms are a frequent occurrence, reducing visibility and hindering travel. The terrain is varied, with stretches of cracked earth, rocky canyons, and the skeletal remains of dead forests. Notable landmarks include the rusted hulks of pre-Collapse cities, now home to scavengers and raiders, and the imposing peaks of the mountains that form a natural barrier to the east. Water is scarce, with the few remaining rivers and oases fiercely contested.          </p>
          <h3>History          </h3>
          <p>Before the Collapse, this area was a thriving region, known for its industry and innovation. The event, a global catastrophe of unknown origin, decimated the population and infrastructure. Vault 77, one of many bunkers built to preserve humanity, was sealed, its existence a closely guarded secret. Over the decades, survivors emerged from the ruins, forming scattered settlements and battling for resources. The area is marked by the remnants of the old world: crumbling highways, derelict factories, and the haunting echoes of a lost civilization. The struggle for survival has led to frequent conflicts, with factions vying for control of the limited resources and the secrets of the past.          </p>
          <h3>Culture          </h3>
          <p>The culture of the wasteland is defined by survival. Communities are often small, isolated, and fiercely protective of their resources. Customs and traditions vary, but a common thread is the importance of strength, resourcefulness, and a willingness to do whatever it takes to survive. Technology is revered, with pre-Collapse artifacts and knowledge highly prized. Raiders, scavengers, and traders roam the wasteland, each with their own codes and motivations. The technologically advanced survivors in Vault 77 represent a different culture, one that values order and control, and views the outsiders with suspicion. The constant threat of violence and scarcity has fostered a sense of paranoia and distrust, making alliances fragile and survival a daily struggle.          </p>
